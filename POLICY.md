# Policy

This policy describes a segregated multi-signature wallet, designed to
transparently manage a sum of 5,000,000 DOGE. The DOGE held in this wallet
will disburse rewards to developers of Dogecoin Core for work on all
contributions, no matter how big or small.

A multi-signature wallet shall be created, to be operated by Dogecoin Core
developers and members of the Dogecoin Foundation. The wallet shall be secured
with a three out of five signature threshold, with the following custodians:

* Michi Lumin (Dogecoin Core developer, Dogecoin Foundation Board)
* Ross Nicoll (Former Dogecoin Core developer)
* Patrick Lodder (Dogecoin Core developer)
* Marshall Hayner (Dogecoin Foundation Board)
* chromatic (Dogecoin Core developer)

The wallet shall operate as follows:

1. With every major or minor release of Dogecoin Core, 500,000 DOGE shall be
   distributed among all contributors credited in the release notes
   since the previous major or minor release, exclusively. A release must meet
   a threshold of at least 25 non-whitespace/comment-only pull requests to
   qualify as a major or minor release. These are the only permissible
   transfers out from this wallet.
2. The height of the payout for each individual contributor will be weighed
   based on the process used for the Dogecoin Core tip jar, to minimize
   duplication of work, or based thereon if no functional Dogecoin Core
   tip jar exists at that time.
3. Custodians do not have any rights to the money held in the wallet,
   individually or as a group.
4. All distributions shall be publicly announced and distributed widely across
   social media channels to the best of the abilities of the custodians.
5. A custodian can only request succession for their own slot but cannot
   nominate their successor. The remaining custodians shall publicly
   nominate a replacement and unanimously agree on the appointment of
   the successor. When this process is completed in full and a successor
   is appointed, the custodian is relieved of all duties.
6. If a custodian is unreachable without notice for a period of 3 months
   or more, the remaining custodians shall initiate a succession process
   under clause 5. The affected custodian shall be permitted to return
   to active duty until the succession process has been completed in full.
